Welcome to my personal Emacs configuration. Feel free to make a copy of my files to configure your own experience of emacs :)

** Notes
As ``user-emacs-directory`` differs by computer and operating system, do note that the location of your ``init.el`` might be placed in a different location. For me, ``user-emacs-directory`` is defaulted to ``.emacs.d``, so that's where my init file goes.

The configuration will load up automatically on the initial load of Emacs, and the configuration can be further personalised thereafter.
