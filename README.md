# Pixa_Emacs
Welcome to my personal Emacs configuration. Feel free to make a copy of my files to configure your own experience of emacs!
## Notes
As ``user-emacs-directory`` differs by computer and operating system, do note that the location of your ``init.el`` might be placed in a different location. For me, ``user-emacs-directory`` is defaulted to ``.emacs.d``, so that's where my init file goes.
### Sample of My File Structure
``` bash
.emacs.d
├── config
│   └── config.org
└── init.el
```
